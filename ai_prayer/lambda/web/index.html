            <h2 class="section-title">A Message from the Creator</h2>
            <p class="lead mt-3">This service was born from a period of profound trial. When I was unexpectedly separated from my son, I felt a deep sense of loss. In His Providence, a dear friend, Mrs. Claudia, guided me to write down my petitions to God. This simple act of faith became a lifeline.</p>
            <p class="lead">From this practice, this tool was created. It helps articulate the stirrings of the heart and unites them with the timeless wisdom of Sacred Scripture to compose a personal prayer. This daily ritual has become my sanctuary, a way to offer up my hopes for my son and entrust him to God's loving care. If you are carrying a cross of your own, it is my sincere prayer that this service may offer you solace and a deeper connection to Our Lord. And if your heart feels moved, I would be eternally grateful for your prayers for our reunion.</p>
