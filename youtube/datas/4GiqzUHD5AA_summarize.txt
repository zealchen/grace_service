# Context Engineering for AI Agents: Strategies & Langchain Integration

## **What is Context Engineering?**
- **Definition**: The art/science of curating information in an LLM's context window to optimize agent performance.
- **Key Analogy**: LLMs = CPU, Context Window = RAM (limited capacity requiring curation).
- **Critical for Agents**: Handles long-running tasks, tool feedback accumulation, and avoids context failures (poisoning, distraction, etc.).

## **4 Core Strategies**

### 1. **Writing Context**
- **Purpose**: Save information externally for later retrieval.
  - **Scratch Pads**: Temporary notes during a task (e.g., Anthropic’s multi-agent researcher saving plans to memory).
  - **Long-Term Memory**: Cross-session retention (e.g., ChatGPT’s memory feature, Generative Agents synthesizing past interactions).
- **Langchain Tools**:
  - **State Objects**: Checkpointed runtime state accessible across agent nodes.
  - **Built-in Memory**: Supports persistent storage across sessions.

### 2. **Selecting Context**
- **Purpose**: Retrieve only relevant information for the current task.
  - **Tool Selection**: Embedding-based retrieval for relevant tools (avoiding overload; e.g., RAG over tool descriptions).
  - **Knowledge Retrieval**: Hybrid RAG techniques (embeddings + graph DBs + LLM ranking) in code agents like Cursor.
  - **Memory Types**: 
    - *Procedural* (instructions/rules), 
    - *Semantic* (facts), 
    - *Episodic* (past examples).
- **Langchain Tools**:
  - **Memory Retrieval**: Embedding-based search from long-term memory.
  - **Pre-built Tool Selector**: Semantic search over tool descriptions.

### 3. **Compressing Context**
- **Purpose**: Retain only essential tokens.
  - **Summarization**: 
    - Full-session compression (e.g., Claude Code’s `autocompact` at 95% context limit).
    - Targeted compression (e.g., Anthropic’s sub-agent handoffs).
  - **Trimming**: Heuristic (keep recent messages) or LLM-based pruning.
- **Langchain Tools**:
  - Utilities for summarization/trimming.
  - Custom post-processing in tool nodes (e.g., trimming tool outputs).

---

### 4. **Isolating Context**
- **Purpose**: Split context across components to avoid overload.
  - **Multi-Agent Systems**: 
    - Sub-agents with dedicated contexts (e.g., OpenAI’s Swarm, Anthropic’s parallel researchers).
  - **Sandboxing**: 
    - Isolate token-heavy data (e.g., Hugging Face’s code execution environment).
  - **State Object Schemas**: Partition data into fields (e.g., Pydantic models).
- **Langchain Tools**:
  - **Multi-Agent Support**: Supervisor/Swarm implementations.
  - **Sandbox Integration**: E.g., E2B for code execution with state persistence.

---

## **Langchain’s Role**
- **State Management**: Centralized state objects for scratchpad-like functionality.
- **Memory & Retrieval**: Long-term storage + semantic search.
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Custom nodes for compression, tool post-processing, and multi-agent workflows.
- **Evaluation**: Tools like Langsmith for tracking tokens and measuring context engineering impact.

## **Key Takeaways**
- Context engineering is critical for agent scalability and reliability.
- Hybrid approaches (e.g., RAG + summarization + multi-agent) often yield best results.
- Langchain provides low-level control to implement all four strategies effectively.
