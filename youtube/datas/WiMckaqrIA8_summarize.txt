# Building an Autonomous AI Video Agent: Step-by-Step Guide

## 🎯 Core Objective
Create an AI system that automatically recreates viral YouTube Shorts by analyzing and emulating popular content trends.

## 🔧 Key Components & Workflow

### 1. **Content Analysis**
- **YouTube Data API**: 
  - Fetches top 10 most-viewed shorts from last 7 days
  - Extracts video URLs for processing

### 2. **AI Video Understanding**
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**:
  - Analyzes YouTube URLs to extract scene structures
  - Generates descriptive image prompts for each scene
  - Outputs JSON with scene breakdowns and recreation prompts

### 3. **Visual Generation**
- **Imagen (Google)**:
  - Creates images from text prompts
  - Maintains character/style consistency across scenes
- **Cling 2.1**:
  - Generates 5-second video clips from images+prompts
  - Anime style applied for creative reinterpretation

### 4. **Assembly & Output**
- Combines generated clips with background music
- Creates final short video compilation

## 🛠️ Technical Setup
- **Required APIs**:
  - YouTube Data API
  - Google Gemini API
  - FoulAI (for video generation)
- **Environment**:
  - Python project in Cloud Code
  - API keys management through .env file

## 💡 Key Insights & Results
- **Scene Optimization**: Reduced 34 original scenes → 5 core scenes for efficiency
- **Demo Outcome**:
  - Successfully recreated scene structure from original short
  - Anime-style reinterpretation showed creative potential
  - Quality limitations highlight need for iterative improvements

## 🚀 Pro Tips
- Use Cloud Code/Cursor for rapid prototyping
- Start with free Gemini CLI before scaling
- Maintain character consistency across prompts
- Experiment with different visual styles
