If you are passionate about Math, working with data in Excel to identify trends and transforming those trends into words to describe to non-technical employers, then you should consider a career in data science.@@u_gona_get_addictive what the heck bro let him wander ...... but why data science after a bio and chem@@JenniferFairgate99 how you are with maths and statistics in your school studies? cuz this will be your challenge.I am a student studying software engineering but I was unable to download the book 😢 because they are asking for my company url which I don&#39;t have one 😢😢started my developer journey feels motivated to see this !!❤‍🔥It&#39;s not AI it is outsourcing that&#39;s killing the industryThanks for this great advice 👏👏Yeah, I know vibe coders handle just UI and landing pages  <br>When it comes to full stack, they don&#39;t even know how to handle everything well said, GitHub CEOLoved this interview! While many worry about AI replacing us, I’m more curious about oversaturation in the Dev space. Now that anyone can learn to code, how do we stand out? What’s your take? 👀Thomas meet meI didn&#39;t know this guy, but I liked him. It seems to be honest and humble considering his positionNo, I don&#39;t want AI to think like me because I don&#39;t want it to replace me.HiHiHiVery intellectual discussion between Silicon Vally Girl and Mr. Thomas Dohmke. Key take away is that Software engineer will remain in demand for quit a long time and this very satisfying for me 🙂you just contradicted yourself <br><br><br>🤣🤣AI isn’t the threat. Ignoring it is. Devs who learn to use it well will lead the next wave.AI is reducing grunt work. Vibe coding (low-code/no-code + AI-assisted dev) helps only for simple UI/web tools — not for enterprise systems, scalable backends, fintech, healthtech, infra, etc. Companies don&#39;t want &#39;AI-generated projects&#39;😅they want smart combo of original human thinking+deep system understanding+real project-building capability with AI tools, that’s who will win 2025+. Ignore the noise. Focus on what you are good at. 😊So some ceos are telling us AI is going live like Skynet and were all doomed, while others are telling us that AI is nothing more than a developer&#39;s aide. You can tell theres confusion on the matterLove u babe ..❤I wonder how these CEOs have the authority to determine our future. Some would suggest to code, some would say something else as if we became the slaves (I know we are).I think, you are the main creator. AI is just an assistant, not just in the context of vibe coding and stuff. It’s like a GPT(General Purpose Technology) like the Internet. So, Like it or not you just have to learn AI. Just a thought 💭What he&#39;s basically trying to say is, &quot;Please keep coding and uploading your amazing codes to GithHub so that we can train our Copilot to be formidable enough to automate tasks and replace you using your own Code! &quot;I builded my company website using only bip coding .AI adding more work to the backlog isn’t a sign of progress, it’s a red flag.”<br>It’s not productivity, it’s chaos dressed up as &quot;innovation.&quot;<br><br>When teams are flooded with more ideas than focus, quality drops. When AI spits out functional, but fragile code, technical debt piles up. And when everything is “in progress” AKA backlog, but nothing gets finished, what&#39;s the point?<br><br>This isn’t acceleration, it’s fragmentation.<br><br>Go ahead, keep riding the AI hype train. Just don’t be surprised when it derails under the weight of unfinished features, bloated backlogs, and burnout.At the end of the day, the person developer who understands all fronted, backend and databases will get the job done faster using AI by prompting better and identifying those error messages that show every time ai makes a mistake, the Key is SPEED of production, who will do it faster with quality, gets the largest piece of the pieSpeed and quality rarely go hand in hand. Quality takes focus, and focus takes time. Even a skilled dev ends up wasting time fixing AI-generated bugs or wrestling with prompts. So now you’ve got messy, tedious code and the extra overhead of managing the AI. Why would any developer choose that? It’s completely counterintuitiveI have been following Lingua Marina chanel for few years, I am surprised to know she is in tech industry, awesome!,  I will really enjoy this chanelbeautiful women.haha, 15% computer science student are jobless and now is the best timeI finished myself off on silicon valley girl on every videoWhy are they screaming?I&#39;ve had plenty of interviews since vibe coding has become a thing, not one technical interviewer asked me about ai nor was I allowed to be prompting during the interview. They want to know you know theory, technical specifics and can answer scenarios properly. I am working on several projects and use AI for assistance but once they begin to scale past the basics the prompting can start to introduce more issues that only a versed dev can solve; like a conductor of music has to know music. Great Video love this person&#39;s explanation!Anybody who has used AI for coding will agree with this man. The fact that AI can write code doesn&#39;t exempt you from not knowing what it&#39;s doing. This is atleast true for any professional developer or who wants to be one. Rest of the people may come up with working code using AI but they won&#39;t be able to scale it or optimise it for commercial usage.I agree with you, but I also believe AI will soon become even better at scaling and optimizing commercial use cases. I use it on a daily basis and, for now, it is fantastic, serving both as a search engine and as a source of design and implementation ideas. Whenever it suggests a solution, I always verify the facts and sources. These days AI is my primary search tool, and it will likely stay that way, because traditional search engines have become cluttered with ads and SEO noise.As a non coder wouldn&#39;t u just have to master the prompt? I would say there lies the true powerBeen a developer 25 years and this new movement has really made it fun and exiting again ❤I totally agree with his vision Bravo!Incredible perspective. This really captures why now is the most exciting — and transformative — time to be a developer and use of AI.He’s right. AI is more like a complex autocomplete tool. But you still need to understand whether to accept the suggested code or not. If you don’t, you’ll get stuck no matter how smart your AI agent is.I do not understand how they can make that statement when they are looking for more ways to not hire programmers.They will not be able to replace developers completely in near future, <br>But what happening is senior developers are get empowered and they need less juniors to delegate.👋😊 I&#39;m currently studying Biology, Chemistry, and Physics for A/Ls in Sri Lanka and I&#39;m really passionate about becoming a data scientist one day. I plan to follow a degreemaybe through a private campus or any hell but I don’t have an IT background yet. Will that be a big challenge when stepping into data science? Have any of you successfully made this kind of shift? Would love to hear your stories or advice!i got my first job as a software developer depsite having a commerce background,you just need a roadmap and a mentor and a couple of projects to showcase in your resume and you will land a job.@@albxn747 thank you for your advice so much!i appreciate your willingness to respond in a helpful way ❤@@JenniferFairgate99 do u need help starting outHi Marina, <br>Amazing interview, thanks!&quot;Always a pleasure to hear Thomas talking.I would arguably say learn Cloud and touch other domains like Hardware, Networking, Databases, Security, and AI. Use AI to write manual code, but learn how to connect cloud services to build applications. It’s important to understand code, but writing code is a small part. If you want to create MVPs quickly, you can use BaaS.so ai could take more jobs?First person who is really very positive about ai and future of aiI like the way he was mentioning, it brings positive things to everyone. AI is a tool that makes people more productive;  why don&#39;t we hire more and do more things instead of replacing people? That is quite the same ideal as Sundar Pichai. Another guy is Mark Zuckerberg, Every time he has a chance to interview, he always says negative things like AI will replace people soon, but he doesn&#39;t know that this statement will impact everyone who is in the first step to becoming a software developer, making people more fearful, make everything simple become complex.Microsoft has already admitted that at the very least 30% of its code is written by AI. So go peddle this nonsense somewhere elseFree training data for microsoftAll these layoffs to save money and recycle the workersCan you use AI to code if you don&#39;t know how to code?? I don&#39;t think so..Lol your wrong.The truth always lies in the middle, it&#39;s not going to replace developers but it will cut the number of jobs for developers.He&#39;s wrong. If AI is writing 90% of the code, the project scope won&#39;t increase 10 times. AI has ONE single purpose. Reduce costs for businesses.Insightful, no hype-pumped interview, with a lot of rational arguments. Looks like the realistic direction. Cheers Thomas.Trust a CEO lol.Everyone can be replaced...except developers.<br>Developers are the ones integrating the AI that will replace every other job.Doctors will be replaced before programmers 100%I like this videoIt feels like he’s holding back or not being completely honest with answering the question of what he’s teaching his kids or what people should be learning right now.  Too vague or generic. Something he doesn’t wanna have to say out loud and admit to us…? 🤔Vibe coding is an even worse trend than low-code/no-code… Who’s seriously willing to pay big money for someone with no real skills generating random code?!🕺🥳 I have real technical skills, so imagine how many &#39;vibe coding’ jobs i could handle at once!! 💰💰💰💰Great content, thanks for sharing!I do zero shot with chatgptA good video that helps ease my fears about AI. It reminds me that AI is just a tool — and we are the orchestrators.INFORMATIVEBest time for developers? BIG NO. Developers salary went down almost 50% now and Companies who still pay HUGE amount  and do not utilize the full potential of AI are LOSERs in the game 😁The idea to an app doesn&#39;t require you to be a developer - Vibe coding is the answer loli dont NVidia, NASA etc are going top vibe code their codebase.<br><br>Its a battle of knowledge, who ever chooses to not lean on AI to think for them wins. Can you leverage LLMs sure. But if you cant formulate your own ideas and have an deep understanding of what you are building, you will lose.This is my first time watching your video, Marina! And I thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking forward to more positivity. 🌟I started out as a &quot;vibe coder.&quot; But if a vibe coder is someone who just prompts without understanding the structure of the codebase, then I no longer fall into that group.<br><br>I believe you can accelerate your learning by mixing different tools, ultimately cutting down the learning curve. However, if you want to build something of value—something secure and well-structured—you’ll need to go beyond &quot;vibe coding.&quot; Relying solely on prompts and following outputs blindly won’t get you there.<br><br>If your backend isn’t securely set up, there are subtle mistakes you can easily make—especially if you lack experience. Eventually, you&#39;ll end up hiring someone to fix those issues. That’s why it’s important to be fully immersed in the process and to constantly ask the right questions.<br><br>For those who are willing, it is possible to move beyond just being a &quot;vibe coder&quot; and into truly becoming a developer—someone who uses tools and technology not just to build an idea, but to learn how to do it right along the way.<br><br>Personally, &quot;vibe coding&quot; and large language models inspired me to start learning, and they helped fast-track my progress by flattening the learning curve. That in itself is a good enough reason to just start now, as time is scarce and invaluable for everybody. But there&#39;s a lot that goes into the process. If you’re not willing to stick through issues that may take days to resolve, then good luck.<br><br>And make no mistake about it, coming from a non-tech background and with enough discipline and willingness, you can get ahead so much faster because you’re not bound by rules While others are stuck unlearning bad habits, trying to rewrite outdated workflows, and fighting their own resistance to change—you?<br><br>You have zero baggage.<br><br>No old systems slowing you down. No years of doing things the “traditional” way. You’re free to adapt faster.<br><br>and... in a space like AI?<br><br>Speed matters.More dvelopes with low paychecks😢At last I hear a grounded opinion on this subject. The area is so overhyped that must people talk without really having any experience about what they are talking about.Hearing different opinion on AI is like a breath of air underwaterCripes 🎉😅❤it is time to start CybersecurityChal Jhooti!Developers won’t be replaced by AI.<br>But developers who don’t use AI will be replaced by those who do — and do it well.<br><br>This is not the end of programming — it’s the beginning of a new race:<br>those who know how to collaborate with AI coding tools will lead the future.Great takeDevelopers won’t be replaced by AI, but their wages will take a hit@@wenterinfaer7868 And working conditions will be terrible for a while as ignorant CEO want 10x productivity from devs.If you knew anything about engineering you wouldn’t make such a clown of yourself.Absolutely​@okey5818  u didn&#39;t make a single point!What is the purpose of human life?<br><br>To improve our human life, but in this case, instead of working on our health and longevity, we are creating automated machines that will eliminate us in the future.<br><br>What about human biology and its upgrades, I can still die if I fall from a great height. And or a car hits me, breaking me into pieces.<br><br>Where has the human body advanced to protect itself from all these fatal situations? This is worrying to me.@nikhilPUD01who said that the purpose of life?It&#39;s the worst time to be a developer! Please if you like programming say as an artist like to paint then go for it. Otherwise, just learn it as a side useful skill while actually learning something  useful, math, law.. whatever.then what job should tech people go for?@@anonymousbird-4 If you like tech, then go for tech. I&#39;m just saying &quot;programming&quot; is flooded with experts and the flood is not stopping!​@@fojico1234okie dokie.<br>Thank you kindly.Awesome video and insights !! Love your work, thanks :)The best people to use vibe coding are developers who understand code at a detailed level. They can quickly spot where the AI might make mistakes and identify any vulnerabilities in the code—both crucial for building reliable software. Being a coder is more than just writing code; it’s about being able to read, understand, and fix AI-generated code, rather than just relying on the app being created. Keep in mind, technical debt can be costly. For non-technical vibe coders, this often means you’ll need to hire more skilled developers when issues arise.<br><br>There’s a reason why no-code developers haven’t replaced professional, traditional developers despite some experts predicting no-code would take over by 2025. From my experience, humans aren’t as good at predicting the future as they often believe. No-code development, like vibe coding, is a democratic way to build software—it makes development more accessible—but it’s mostly hype until the reality of complex projects sets in. Understanding this keeps expectations realistic.<br><br>If we all believe coding isn’t necessary because AI can do it, we risk losing confidence in ourselves. Our skills and judgment will weaken, and we won’t be able to make firm decisions when challenges arise. This is just food for thought.I don&#39;t know what do you mean, but Habibi come to dubai and you will find out if it&#39;s the best time to be a developer or notWhy bro , I think there would be no jobs for the developers or what?Your videos and topics you&#39;re choosing are pretty amazing ❤AI can never be intelligent like humans, because it cannot feel. It doesn&#39;t have emotions. Most of humanity discoveries are guided by our emotions. We can feel it when we see something great, something nice, something ugly!!!I don&#39;t think we are developing less complex softwares because we can&#39;t code it fast or we are stopping ourselves from coding new ideas because we can&#39;t code. But I can understand why AI companies make us to believe so 😅<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR__eFQsnhg&amp;t=84">1:24</a> Wrong copilot logo.

Let&#39;s break it down piece by piece:<br>🔹 Claim: &quot;GPT-5 isn’t just a language model anymore. It&#39;s a unified neural architecture—text, code, images, video, all in one.&quot;<br><br>    Partially true: GPT-4o (the latest model as of mid-2025) already supports multimodal input and output—it can understand and generate text, code, images, and speech, and even interact with video frames in some experimental use cases.<br><br>    GPT-5 (if/when released) may build on this, but there is no confirmed information that it will represent a completely new unified architecture that makes older tools obsolete.<br><br>🔹 Claim: &quot;It literally does everything... Codex, DALL·E, Whisper, and GPT-4 smashed into one perfect AI mega-system.&quot;<br><br>    Misleading: GPT-4o already combines capabilities of Codex (code), DALL·E (images), Whisper (speech), and GPT-4 (text).<br><br>    But it&#39;s not “perfect,” and still makes mistakes, especially in reasoning, long context retention, and factual accuracy. No system does everything perfectly.<br><br>🔹 Claim: &quot;Sam Altman hinted it’s smarter than any human in specialized tasks.&quot;<br><br>    False or at best unverified: Sam Altman has made public comments about future AI models potentially surpassing human experts in narrow domains, but no official claim or private leak confirms GPT-5 is currently beyond all human specialists.<br><br>    Even GPT-4 and GPT-4o have limitations and are far from infallible in complex tasks.<br><br>🔹 Claim: &quot;Expect it to rewrite scientific papers, crunch complex math, debug codebases instantly.&quot;<br><br>    Exaggerated: While advanced models can assist with all those tasks, they are not autonomous agents. They often need human oversight, context, and corrections.<br><br>    Debugging &quot;entire codebases instantly&quot; is fantasy at this stage—models can help, but aren&#39;t plug-and-play miracle workers.<br><br>🔹 Claim: &quot;GPT-5 is an AI operating system that runs natively on your laptop, phone, neural hardware...&quot;<br><br>    False: GPT-4 and GPT-4o are cloud-based and require heavy computation—they do not run natively on local devices (except in limited, optimized smaller versions like GPT-4-mini or distilled models).<br><br>    “Neural hardware” is speculative and sounds more like marketing sci-fi than current reality.<br><br>✅ Conclusion:<br><br>This comment is mostly hype and fiction, likely meant to stir excitement or fear. While AI is advancing quickly—especially with multimodal capabilities and better efficiency—we are still far from the kind of AI &quot;mega-brain&quot; described in this comment. Always rely on official OpenAI updates or reputable AI research sources for accurate information.​​😂😂💀 I am the  culprit arrest me but it&#39;s likely be true sam altman already gave a hint in the podcast that the up coming models are going to change the world. Have you ever thought that a gemini would create such a thing.... And this update is recent one even chatgpt doesn&#39;t know about this update. @@lukeskyvader3217Love your content ma&#39;am from india🇮🇳One of the few sober CEOs out there👏👏👏yeahI’m hoping that AI makes it so you don’t need to come onto a platform and have someone pushing adverts. Imagine an ad free society, bliss.As a QA engineer in Russia I&#39;d like more such content. Thanks, Marina.How is QA in Russia? What do u work on?what is QA?​@shahanraiwell, i think the processes and trends in Russia today are similar to processes in other world. If we want to focus on automation QA so the most vacancies are for Java AQA because we have a lot of big fintech companies. Unfortunately there are not so many startups, small and middle companies and the sphere today (since 2022) is not so large for engineers - and they walk around the circle of Russian bigtech like sberbank, tinkoff_bank, maybe yandex, etc. I work as a fullstack QA at the  popular russian social network.@@primecrest Quality Assurance Most doing the teststhanks ❤​@@VenikhTVIf it&#39;s such a great time to be a developer, where are the jobs???😂There are too many in the global market but difficult to access since end of 2024I guess the differentiator will be how well changes can be made to software and how well it evolves over time.It&#39;s not worth it anymore, the paycheck keeps getting smallerHis English pronunciation still closed a little bit to Deutsch 😂😂 like the pronunciation of the letter rI agree, AI has doubled my productivity, especially since am a solo dev, I have been using gemini and chatgpt to genereate code for me, I always make sure to give these models the coding style and organization I require in my work, and also review all the code produced, and sofar so good. Though I have noticed it has sort of made me lazy on writing code by hand, am doubling down on it a it now. I love coding.I&#39;ve been a developer for 20 years, following your channel for a few years (which is productivity-oriented most of the time), and I wasn&#39;t expecting this interview that feels so DEV-oriented. I love it. Thanks for putting all this excellent work ♥May I ask how much you can earn per month? I&#39;m just far from the IT sphere and I&#39;m just curious to know how much a person with so much experience can earnHello I&#39;m a beginner web developer do you have any advice for me 🙏Thank youremember that all our code is sold to train models ;DI thought developers are being laid off in droves. Am I missing something?Right?? Like where are the jobs then, if it&#39;s such a good time to be a developer???😂​@@evan8168 yeah I think this video is pure hopiumIt has nothing to do with AI. For the past years (post covid), big tech has massively hired, at a point where 10 to 15% of the people had nothing to do (like really nothing). The current crisis lead to the firing of this people plus the layoffs that always follow an economic crisis. The tech bubble just popped. Nothing special.I stand to be corrected. I think now may not be the best time to be a developer, but in the coming years,  developers who can use A. I to maximize productivity may be in demand.Very Helpfull as a  Android Developer , Thank you!<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a>wait, is this the Linguamarina?This interview with the GitHub CEO was 🔥 super inspiring for developers right now!

You can dear.I have just started an Engineering degree, I had no previous coding experience. There are plenty of free resources out there. You should check out Anaconda Navigator, PyCharm for Python. All have free versions and really good if you are planning on becoming a data scientist. I will just take my time learning and by the time my graduation comes round I should be proficient at coding.@@DreamerHoney 😊<br>Thanks a lot for your reply!

Private equity is buying many of the mom and pop businesses in the trades and then using economies of scale to underbid the other mom and pop business.

People should think when it comes to accepting the ideas of all these CEOsExactly! Almost everyone has something to sell you! CEOs even more so. I’ll take his opinion with a huge grain of salt.Being a software engineer is not just about writing code. And these systems get really complicated AI is not at that level yet. I am a systems engineer and I use AI everyday and there are some things that AI just can&#39;t do. Maybe in the next 5 years we&#39;ll see.If you are not a software engineer and you think AI will replace engineers soon I&#39;ll give you a simple task to do to as a fun challenge. Let&#39;s see if you&#39;ll be able to do this with the vibe coding platforms. Build an MCP server with rust on a raspberry pi. This is very simple.​@@mwansa430you just said software engineering is not about building software and you just have a software task to try to prove your point 😆😆.

And writing code and building software are two different things.😂@@parzival123 Are u a dev?Bro if dev are replaced it would be sure that every work that needs cognitive abilities would be done by ai​@@rishionesevenfourzero I see many logical errors made by AI in creating a very small segment of code. IDK why people don’t get it that sometimes AI doesn’t fully understand the problem, and it makes it more complicated. So instead of believing in them, we need to be experts. The worry is that people are getting more reliant on these platforms, and the code is not that &quot;production worthy&quot;. Also, the cost of AI is deliberately high, so in the future, if industries are going to adopt this tech in full terms, then I don’t see an upgrade in software development and it will be more like an update for AI.Yh thats the same platform that AI coding models are built from. Ai needs huge data to be trained , where do you think it got it from? Yall must think of AI as some genius thinking machine huh?Even AI will need versioning. He could have been excited by that, but he chose a human perspective.That’s correct. You know what’s even more true?<br><br>Everytime you’re seeing somebody from Microsoft or anywhere else saying that AI will take developer jobs soon, is SELLING AI TOOLS.Then you&#39;ve got all the you tubers calling out the end of the world due to an AI takeover .. but really all they want is for you to smash the like button &amp; hit subscribe while you watch their videos 😅I am from India you are my favourite influencer 💖 in social media mamHe is just promoting his coding platform.

If you are passionate about Math, working with data in Excel to identify trends and transforming those trends into words to describe to non-technical employers, then you should consider a career in data science.@@u_gona_get_addictive what the heck bro let him wander ...... but why data science after a bio and chem@@JenniferFairgate99 how you are with maths and statistics in your school studies? cuz this will be your challenge.I am a student studying software engineering but I was unable to download the book 😢 because they are asking for my company url which I don&#39;t have one 😢😢
